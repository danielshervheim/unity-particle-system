# Particle System

I wrote this particle simulation as a project for an animation and planning course I took in university.

## Setup

- Clone this repository, and open it in Unity.

- Create a new `Scene` in the editor.

- Add an empty `GameObject`.

- Add the `Emitter.cs` script to the empty `GameObject`.

- Setup the `Emitter` as desired, and press play to see the particle system in action.
